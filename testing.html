                <h2>Benefits and drawbacks of IT at Work</h2>
                <p>There are a number of benefits to IT in the workplace from computing, automation, design, research ... The list literally increases all of the time, the main benefit most recently has been in the role of computing as a communications device. </p>

                <h2>Efficiency as an individual or as a team</h2>
                <p>There are always lessons to learn from projects upon review, it could be something as simple as using the wrong approach, spending too little time understanding the problem causing a premature start on the solution. For this project, more of the items on the 'Could Have' list would have been viable as the research and learning time could be done by one person, whilst other quick-wins are being carried out along side the main stream of work on the Trello boards.</p>

                <p>The mix of experience and culture also offers an opportunity to look at the heuristic design elements from their individual and collective prespectives which further increases reach and accessibility. Other advantages are the ability to have a sound-board to test ideas and ensure understanding. Sounding out concepts and structures is a valuable tool, but when in a group, you get realtime feedback that can aid in working through difficulties.</p>

                <h2>Responding to issues</h2>
                <p>The site was built to provide examples of various concepts from the CodeNation - Coding Bootcamp; there were a number of minor issues that were more a result of a typo or, in one case moving an image around a section for a softer experience which a paragraph had been copied with. The result was the same paragraph twice, a simple fix but was spotted by a thrird party that was having a read through the content.</p>
                
                <p>Early in the design process, before styles had been applied it was dark and heavy dense text with white on black writing. This was never intended as the final design feature, but it did require more thought on fonts, colour scheme and also the means of providing depth to the page to separate the content from the background.</p>

                <p>Another feature of VScode that has made the process more efficient is that there are extensions that monitor the code for syntax errors; likewise, there is also an extension called ‘Live Server’ that has allowed me to have a constant local host version of the site open that updates each time I make a change in VScode. This is just a good as brands such as Adobe, but without the recurring costs.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Testing in the dgital world</h2>
                <p>There are a number of methods to test code; one example is in the Python project; build an adventure game in Python, there were three differnt quiz games, plus the udser-defined pathway through the game. The user-defined pathway included the dialogue, the links and the flow of the game in its total, plus it was the narrative for the entire game. The puzzles were indeendent games that were built separately and then tested for bugs before being submitted for the final game. Each module was added independently to ensure the 'pathway' still provided the correct flow and timing and then linked to and from the individual games. This was then repeated; the major difference was that when one area had been completed and submitted, the dveloper then liaised with the team to identify what could be done to aid in the smooth development in its entirity.</p>
