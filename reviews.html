                <h2>Are the tools in use still fit for purpose, or is there a need for a paradigm shift?</h2>
                <p>Visual Studio Code, Trello, Word incorporated to use for spelling, punctuation and grammar, there are open source options such as Libre Office, Open Office or Google Docs, but it is installed and has been a staple for 20 years.</p>

                <p>Trello is still a great way to re-focus and keep an eye on tasks and manage time; the last thing needed in a project is a back-log forming and placing unnecessary pressure that could jeopardise the project delivery and even the quality.</p>

                <img class="image_article" src="./img/cn_trello_update.png">

                <p>The fact that it is such a simple tool to use and it can be accessed from anywhere that there is an internet connection makes it even more useful. In the same manner Slack also works in the same light, it is portable and can be accessed on virtually any device.</p>

                <img class="image_article" src="./img/word.png">

                <h2>Where the tools selected appropriate</h2>
                <p>VScode with the multitude of extensions has become a preference over a number alternatives and it is fully capable of handling web development and for a wealth of other projects. For the building of this information site, it has not been over-extended or strained, the process is smooth and fast and whilst it does miss.</p>

                <p>VScode was easy to use and efficient with someexcellent extensions that helped with syntax errors and real-time updates, the auto-fill suggestions were accurate and over-all it is very intuitive.</p>

                <img class="article" src="./img/affinity.png" alt="Screen shot of Serif's Affinity Design with some basic images">

                <p>I opted to use Affinity Design by Serif for my graphics as this is a brand that I have recently moved to due to the range of tools, easy to use interface and the added bonus that there are no subscription fees (the deciding factor in my leaving Adobe Creative Cloud).</p>

                <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
                <p>The site at point of inception was to simulate a periodical; however, having three people in my household that suffer varying degrees of dyslexia, they found the bright backing a more difficult medium to read anything for a prolonged period.</p>

                <p>Options that were considered were the incorporation of a 'Cerium wheel' however, there were a number of areas that needed to be more time than was available. Referring back to the first page, expectations were part of the initial planning and upon reviewing a number of sites and looking at the learning curve, and the drafting of a 'Must have', 'Should have', 'Could have' list; sadly that was not going to be workable; however of the styles I had looked at the incorporation of a a subtle solid colour for the backing, with an off-white font colour.</p>

                <p>There are several positive comments made regarding the site; however, the landing page was always going to be text-heavy, this being a key factor in the decision to use an ezine or online newspaper flavour to the site. With that, there were other design choices that could have addressed the tope heavy feel, but to ensure it followed the format of the original brief, covering three-targeted outcomes for this project and still be navigable.
                </p>

                <p>The site is intended to act as a showcase of the increasing skills that I develop as I move on in my learning in this industry, this site was to showcase key outcomes (hence the amount of text), whereas the next will be for a completely different genre looking at visual representation over conventional text-based content.
                </p>

                <h2>Further improvements</h2>
                <p>Further improvements would be to include additional media in the form of video as this would be an avenue that would allow further accessibility and reduce the amount of text required to cover all of the material. Whilst this would require incorprating further skills than currently available and would likely require more time for completion, or to utilise other developers to deliver richer content on time and to budget where applicable.</p>
