                <h2>Describing the role of IT in <em>'my'</em> work</h2>
                <p>From a requirement in the office to a staple of everyday life; in a nutshell that has been the transformation of IT in my work-life. IT is a vital cog in every area of industry and, as the global pandemic has shown, IT has now completely
                    crossed the divisions of work-life and home-life.</p>

                <img class="image_article" src="./img/working_at_home.jpeg" alt="Picture of a desk with paper and pencil and a laptop indicating the the work place at home">

                <p>Home-life is a key change for the role of IT, the two for many years were kept isolate from one another to prevent one encroaching on the other (the adage of work-life-balance). Today we use the same technology for work and to keep our
                    vital bonds with friends and family, that we may not be able to see for numerous reasons (not just the Covid-19 pandemic).</p>

                <p>For IT professionals, age demographics are no longer as important because the same technologies are now used by young an old in the same manner. This has posed multiple challenges as target audiences have now merged into a large community
                    and the special interest groups are now being included in topical conversations on new levels. The same problems are seen by young and old alike and as a result new measures are required to protect a wider, and more vulnerable groups.</p>

                <p>From research to communications, recreation to collaboration; IT is now essential for all aspects of my digital life.</p>

                <img class="image_article" src="./img/paper_first.jpg" alt="picture of a pad and some notes from a meeting with a client">
                <br>
                <h2>What? Methods, Skills and Resources</h2>
                <p>Every plan needs a method; the method needs a flow - for this I needed Trello! It was a great tool for me to lay out the plan and the direction and order of the work. The first project allowed me an opportunity to work with it; this project
                    was more an opportunity for me to get to grips with it and make it my own.</p>

                <p>A suitable means of developing is particularly important; however, previously many of the tools that were a standard in my profession, would not be cost effective for a project like this. Open source and free to use software are more favourable
                    options and are now at a standard that they are as good as premium packages from vendors such as Adobe, for example.</p>

                <img id="flow" src="./img/flow.png" alt="Flow chart of previous project as an example, however it is not relevant to the current project and is not discussed">

                <p>This project (the website) was simple and so it didn’t need to be placed in a wire frame or flow diagram. Trello encompassed the elements that would have been drawn up and then the execution was delivered by using: Visual Studio Code (VScode),
                    search engines (DuckDuckGo, Google), course materials and by asking questions. Asking the question that you are worried will impact the opinion of you in your area. The phrase ‘there is no such thing as a stupid question’, in my opinion
                    is misleading and should read as ‘The only stupid question is the one you didn’t ask when you needed to’.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Planning and carrying out tasks in IT</h2>
                <p>Trello is an integral part of this project, as there are rarely scenarios with only one project being delivered at a time, this allows for returning to the state you left the project in, a quicker review of what was completed last and
                    where the other items are in relation to the project as a whole, and it allows parties to see where the work is up to without the need for physically attending a meeting or pulling resources away for video conferences </p>

                <br>
                <p class="quota">Asking the question that you are worried will impact the opinion of you in your area. The phrase ‘there is no such thing as a stupid question’, in my opinion is misleading and should read as "The only stupid question is the one you didn’t
                    ask when you needed to".</p>

                <h2>Risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
                <p>Scope is an integral part of any digital project. If there is no direction or outcome clearly defined, then there are more opportunities to digress. New ideas can arrive and force a back-track, a new skill, or a new requirement can be
                    rushed through to fit a timeline that has just a start and an end.</p>

                <p>Expectations can be a major issue, following on from the previous point. The stakeholder or client may have requirements that are beyond the skillset of the developers, this can add time and expense as the developer needs to acquire the
                    skill, or a third-party would need to be brought-in for a specific task. If this is not addressed at the start of the project then there could be issues with compatibility; after-all ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’ in this instance.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How to select IT systems and Software</h2>
                <p>RESEARCH! RESEARCH! RESEARCH! To ensure you have the tools required you need to understand the task and any in-direct tasks that may be required. For instance, you need to start with communication, how will this be achieved, how will it
                    be developed and finally how will it be delivered.</p>
                <p>A must: </p>
                <ol id="indent">
                    <li>A phone,</li>
                    <li>computer,</li>
                    <li>compatible software,</li>
                    <li>reliable internet</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Once the hardware and minimum software has been sourced then more specific items such as VSCode, Slack, Draw.io and Trello need to be installed, where appropriate, and training must begin if the skillset is not already held.</p>
                <p>Albert Einstein was attributed as the origin for the following</p>
                <img class="image_article" src="./img/albert_einstein.jpg" alt="Picture from Wikipedia featuring Albert Einstein">
                <blockquote>”If all I had was an hour to solve a problem, I would spend 55 minutes on the problem and 5 minutes on the solution.”</blockquote>

                <p>Having previously worked with Macromedia MX products (prior to the take-over) I was familiar with Adobe’s Dreamweaver, Illustrator and InDesign but, having not used Adobe’s Dreamweaver, I opted to stick with Visual Studio Code as it was easy to use and having already completed a project on this platform, I was confident and comfortable and had no doubt that it would prove to be an equally useful tool for this.</p>

                <h2>Describe and provide analysis on how chosen technologies help to achieve outcome</h2>
                <p>Trello was an important tool for the success of the delivery of the project. It provided a base to work from and come back to if there were issues with anything. This was integrated into the Slack channel used for a group project, and
                    in a team for this assignment, would also have been key.</p>

                <img src="./img/vscode.png" alt="A screen shot of Visual Studio Code showing file structures and HTML for a page">

                <p>VScode has been the strongest asset as it is allows the use of short-cuts and auto-fill extensions that make the entre process much more comfortable. Having previously worked with versions of Dreamweaver.</p>

                <p>There was only one feature that I personally missed and that was the preview; however, VScode has an extension ‘Live Server’ which carries out this task and, if using a larger screen works better than the versions of Dreamweaver I have
                    used in the past as once the server is running, few refreshes are required as most changes apply in realtime.</p>

                <h2>Legal guidelines and constraints impacting on digital projectss</h2>
                <p>The impact of GDPR on digital projects has been one of the most significant regulatory changes in recent years. The collection, purpose and use of personal data has been a staple in the industry with breaches being reported from some of
                    the biggest companies in the world. It is now imperative that digital firms ensure that users are aware of what information is collected, the purpose and how it will be used and who it will be shared with. The best example as a widely
                    used on the web is the use of cookies; however, this is a private site and the images with the exception of Albert Einstein, are all intellectual property belonging to me. In future, any use would have to be inline with copyright laws
                    for content not originating with the author. Also, in the future sites will have the added incorporation of a cookies acceptance form for a visitor to a public site to accept or reject prior to browsing the site. Further information
